				<p>
					FIA Formula One World Championship ( aka. Formula One, Formula 1, F1
					), is the world's top level motorsport world championship. Since 1950,
					it is widely recognised as the world's most prestigious motor racing
					competition, as well as the world's most popular annual sporting
					series. The sport has always sought to innovate, constantly pushing
					the technological boundaries in order to find the quickest route to
					victory. The sport has frequently pioneered technology that has been
					successfully transferred to everyday transport. In 2014, with the
					introduction of a new hybrid 1.6 litre, turbo-charged V6 power unit,
					Formula 1 continued its aim to place the world's foremost single-seat
					racing series at the cutting edge of automotive technology
					development. For the next generation power unit there is the
					commitment to move to 100% sustainable fuels in 2025/2026, remaining
					true to the culture of innovation, while at the same time preserving
					the capacity to thrill that has been at the heart of the sport since
					its earliest days.
